# Covid19-Detection using Chest X-ray
This repository is implementation of Covid-Detection models using deep learning approaches.

COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-Rays by building a Simple Convolution Neural Network. 
- Dataset Preparation
- Understanding the Dataset
- Building a CNN
- Model Training

# Datset:
Kaggle X-Ray Chest Images - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

# There are two folders:

1. Covid 19 : using CNN and image detection to detct the Covid patient.
2. classification: To classify the negative and positive images of Covid patient.

--- step-by-step to run code
1. Run command "classification.py" to classify the positive and negative images of Covid patient
2. Run command "covid19.py" to detect that how many patients are covid positive and negative using confusion matrix.
